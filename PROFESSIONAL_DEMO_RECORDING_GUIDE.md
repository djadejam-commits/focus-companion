## 🎬 PART 2: Shot-by-Shot Demo Script

### SCENE 1: Introduction (15 seconds)

**ACTION**:
- Show Dashboard screen, calm and steady

**VOICEOVER (Read naturally)**:
> "Hi, I'm Adeoluwa Tokuta, and I built **Focus Companion** - an AI-powered mobile app that helps students stay focused during study sessions by detecting when they unconsciously pick up their phone using Edge Impulse machine learning."

**CAMERA**:
- Hold iPhone steady on Dashboard
- Keep app in frame entire time

**TIMING**: 15 seconds

---

### SCENE 2: Problem Statement (20 seconds)

**ACTION**:
- Still on Dashboard
- Maybe scroll slightly to show session types

**VOICEOVER**:
> "The problem: Students lose an average of 2.5 hours per day to phone distractions. Most pickups aren't intentional - they're unconscious habits. Traditional app blockers are either too aggressive or too easy to bypass."

**VISUAL NOTES**:
- Slow, gentle movements
- Show the three session cards clearly

**TIMING**: 20 seconds

---

### SCENE 3: Session Selection (15 seconds)

**ACTION**:
- Observe cards fade in (if you just opened app - restart if needed for animation)
- Tap **"Deep Work"** session card
- Feel haptic feedback (mention it!)

**VOICEOVER**:
> "Focus Companion offers three session types. Let me start a Deep Work session. Notice the smooth animations and haptic feedback - these micro-interactions make the app feel responsive and premium."

**VISUAL HIGHLIGHTS**:
- ✨ Staggered card fade-in animation
- ✨ Button press animation
- Mention haptic (even though it won't show on screen)

**TIMING**: 15 seconds

---

### SCENE 4: Active Session - The Money Shot! (60 seconds)

**ACTION**:
1. Show Active Session screen loading
2. Hold steady for 5 seconds so viewers see:
   - Circular progress ring
   - Timer with percentage
   - Pulsing "🤖 AI Detection Active" badge
3. Place phone flat on desk (still in frame)
4. Wait 2 seconds
5. **Pick up phone clearly** (this is the key moment!)
6. RefocusScreen appears with flash
7. Breathing animation plays
8. Wait for 3-second auto-resume
9. Back to Active Session

**VOICEOVER**:
> "Here's the magic. The app uses Edge Impulse's on-device machine learning to monitor phone motion in real-time. See the circular progress ring showing session progress, and the pulsing AI detection badge - this builds trust that the system is actively working.
>
> Now watch what happens when I pick up my phone..."
>
> **[PICK UP PHONE]**
>
> "Immediately, the app detects the pickup gesture, triggers a gentle red flash and haptic vibration, and shows a calming refocus screen with breathing animations. The session timer pauses automatically. After three seconds, it resumes - keeping me in flow state without harsh interruptions.
>
> This is real-time Edge Impulse classification running entirely on-device. No cloud, no latency, complete privacy."

**VISUAL HIGHLIGHTS** (Point out while talking):
- ✨ Circular progress ring animation
- ✨ Live percentage updating
- ✨ Pulsing AI badge (say "notice the pulse")
- ✨ **RED FLASH on pickup** (THE MONEY SHOT!)
- ✨ Breathing animation on RefocusScreen
- ✨ Auto-resume after 3 seconds

**CRITICAL NOTES**:
- **Practice the pickup timing** - do it RIGHT when you say "pick up my phone"
- **Hold phone steady** before and after pickup so flash is visible
- **This scene is MOST IMPORTANT** - re-record if detection doesn't work

**TIMING**: 60 seconds

---

### SCENE 5: Session Completion (25 seconds)

**ACTION**:
1. After auto-resume, wait 3-5 seconds
2. Tap **X button** (top left)
3. Tap **"End Session"** in alert
4. Summary screen appears
5. Show celebration animation (if completed) or stats (if early end)

**VOICEOVER**:
> "Let me end this session to show the summary. The app calculates a focus score based on distractions versus session time - with our improved algorithm, three distractions in a 45-minute session still earns a 97% focus score, making it rewarding rather than punishing.
>
> Notice the celebration animation and success haptic feedback - small touches that make completing sessions feel accomplishing."

**VISUAL HIGHLIGHTS**:
- ✨ Summary screen with stats
- ✨ Celebration animation (bouncing trophy if completed)
- ✨ Focus score percentage (should be high, like 95-100%)

**TIMING**: 25 seconds

---

### SCENE 6: Statistics Dashboard (20 seconds)

**ACTION**:
1. Tap to return to Dashboard
2. Show stats grid (if you have previous sessions)
3. Highlight the 4 cards: Today, Week, Avg, Total

**VOICEOVER**:
> "Back on the dashboard, users see comprehensive statistics: sessions completed today, total focus time this week, average focus score, and all-time session count. This enhanced stats dashboard motivates continued use and helps students track their progress over time."

**VISUAL HIGHLIGHTS**:
- ✨ 4-card stats grid with purple numbers
- Point to each stat briefly

**TIMING**: 20 seconds

---

### SCENE 7: Edge Impulse Integration (25 seconds)

**ACTION**:
- **Switch to Mac screen** (QuickTime can record this)
- Open Edge Impulse Studio in browser
- Show your public project
- Navigate to Model Testing or Performance tab

**VOICEOVER**:
> "The machine learning model was trained in Edge Impulse Studio. I collected 175 motion samples - pickups, idle positions, and general movements - using the phone's accelerometer and gyroscope.
>
> The model uses spectral analysis to extract motion signatures, then a neural network classifier to distinguish pickups with 92.5% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.93. It deploys as WebAssembly, running entirely on-device."

**VISUAL HIGHLIGHTS**:
- Show Feature Explorer (if possible)
- Show Model Performance metrics (92.5% accuracy)
- Show deployment type (WASM)

**TIMING**: 25 seconds

---

### SCENE 8: Closing (15 seconds)

**ACTION**:
- Return to iPhone screen (Dashboard or History)
- Hold steady

**VOICEOVER**:
> "Focus Companion demonstrates Edge Impulse's power to make on-device machine learning accessible. From data collection to deployment, Edge Impulse enabled me to build a production-quality AI feature in just three days.
>
> Thank you!"

**VISUAL**:
- Clean, professional ending
- App looks polished

**TIMING**: 15 seconds

## 🎯 PART 3: Recording Best Practices

### Pre-Recording Checklist

**Environment:**
- [ ] Quiet room (no background noise)
- [ ] Good lighting (natural light or desk lamp)
- [ ] Door closed, phone on silent (your other phone!)
- [ ] Pet/family members know you're recording

**Tech:**
- [ ] iPhone connected via cable to Mac
- [ ] iPhone unlocked and on Dashboard
- [ ] QuickTime showing iPhone screen clearly
- [ ] Microphone levels tested (70-80% peak)
- [ ] This script open on Mac for reference

**Personal:**
- [ ] Hydrated (water nearby, no ice cubes!)
- [ ] Comfortable position
- [ ] Relaxed (not rushed)
- [ ] Smiled (it helps your voice sound warm!)

### Recording Strategy

**Option A: Single Take (Advanced)**
- Record entire 3-minute script in one go
- Requires practice (3-5 run-throughs first)
- Pros: Natural flow, authentic
- Cons: One mistake = full re-record

**Option B: Scene-by-Scene (RECOMMENDED)**
- Record each scene separately
- QuickTime: Stop/Start between scenes
- Pros: Easier, less pressure, can perfect each part
- Cons: Need to stitch together (but easy in iMovie)

**Option C: Multiple Full Takes**
- Record 2-3 complete takes
- Pick the best one
- Pros: Safety net, choose best performance
- Cons: Time consuming (30-45 min)

**MY RECOMMENDATION**: **Option B** (Scene-by-Scene)
1. Record Scene 1, stop
2. Review, re-record if needed
3. Move to Scene 2
4. Repeat for all 8 scenes
5. Stitch together in iMovie later (10 minutes)

### During Recording

**Voice Tips:**
- Speak **slightly slower** than normal conversation
- **Pause** between sentences (can trim silence later)
- **Smile** while talking (sounds friendlier)
- **Emphasize** key words: "Edge Impulse", "on-device", "real-time"
- **Project** your voice (not loud, just clear)

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- ❌ Speaking too fast (demo feels rushed)
- ❌ Dead air for too long (seems unprepared)
- ❌ Umms and ahhs (re-record the scene)
- ❌ Clicking/breathing into mic (stay 6-8 inches away)
- ❌ Background noise (laptop fan, traffic)

**If You Make a Mistake:**
- **Small mistake (minor stumble)**: Keep going! Can edit later
- **Big mistake (wrong word, long pause)**: Stop, take a breath, restart that sentence
- **Scene doesn't work**: Stop recording, collect yourself, start scene over

4. **Drag scenes to timeline** in order (Scene 1 → 8)
5. **Trim silence** between scenes:
   - Select clip
   - Drag edges to trim dead space
6. **Add transitions** (optional):
   - Add "Cross Dissolve" (0.3s) between scenes for smooth flow
7. **Add title card** (optional):
   - Opening: "Focus Companion - Edge Impulse AI Competition 2025"
   - Closing: "GitHub: [your-link]"
