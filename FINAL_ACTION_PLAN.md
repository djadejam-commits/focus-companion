## 🎯 What's Left (4 Steps)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository & Push (20 minutes)

**Instructions**: See `GITHUB_SETUP.md`

**Quick steps**:
1. Go to https://github.com → New repository
2. Name: `focus-companion`
3. Public visibility, don't initialize
4. Copy repo URL
5. Run:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/djadejam-commits/focus-companion.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
6. Verify at: `https://github.com/djadejam-commits/focus-companion`

### Step 2: Record Demo Video (1-2 hours)

**Instructions**: See `VIDEO_RECORDING_GUIDE.md`

**Quick flow** (2-3 minutes total):
1. **Hook** (15s): "Students lose 2.5 hours/day to phone distractions..."
2. **Start session** (20s): Show dashboard, tap Study Session, timer starts
3. **Detection demo** (25s): Place phone on desk, pick it up, refocus screen appears ⭐ THE MONEY SHOT
4. **Dismiss feature** (20s): Show dismiss button, counter "X dismisses remaining"
5. **Edge Impulse** (25s): Show training accuracy 92.5%, on-device processing
6. **Summary** (20s): End session, show focus score and stats
7. **Close** (25s): Impact statement, open source, GitHub link

**Recording tips**:
- Practice 2-3 times before recording
- Record detection demo 5 times, pick best
- Use phone screen recording or QuickTime
- Clear, conversational voice
- Enable Do Not Disturb

**Upload to**: YouTube (unlisted or public)

## 💡 Pro Tips

**For Demo Video**:
- The detection demo (Shot 4) is the most important part
- Record it 5 times, use the best take
- Smile while recording voiceover (it shows in your voice!)
- Don't apologize for rough edges - judges expect MVP quality

**For GitHub**:
- Clean commit history shows professionalism
- Good README matters more than perfect code
- Topics/tags help discoverability

**For Edge Impulse**:
- Public project validates you actually used EI
- Judges will check this to verify ML claims
- Good performance metrics (92.5%) are impressive

**For Submission**:
- Don't submit at the last minute (buffer for tech issues)
- Test all links in incognito/private browser
- Screenshot everything (confirmation, links working, etc.)

---

## 🎬 Demo Video Priority

**The detection demo is your proof of concept.**

Make sure these 25 seconds are perfect:
1. Phone clearly visible on desk
2. Your hand picking it up (shows it's real)
3. Refocus screen appears immediately
4. Breathing animation is visible
5. 3-second countdown auto-resumes

Record this shot 5 times if needed. This is what judges remember.
